# Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimization Project

## Overview 
This repo includes the design and implementation of the Quine-McCluskey minimization algorithm. The project allows the user to enter a boolean expression and allows the user to choose any of the several features provided including the minimized boolean expression.. <br> The project specifics are included in the project report [here](https://github.com/MohamedRagabAbbas/Digital-Design-Project-Final-Version-1/blob/main/Digital%20Design%20Project%201.pdf).

## Running the program
To run the program, the user can input his boolean expression is any of the following formats:
#### Input formats 
**1**. Expression in SoP form <br> **2**. A list of minterms <br> **3**. A list of minterms and don't cares <br> 
#### Evaluation Conventions
For the first format, to multiply two or more variables, they should be adjacent without any charcters in between. To add two ore more variables, separate them by a '+' sign. <br> For the second and third formats, the minterms/don't cares must be separated by a space.
