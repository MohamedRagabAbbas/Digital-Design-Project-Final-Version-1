# Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimization Project

## Overview 
This repo includes the design and implementation of the Quine-McCluskey minimization algorithm. The project allows the user to enter a boolean expression and allows the user to choose any output from the following. 1. Truth Table <br> 2. Canonical Sum of Products (SoP) 3. Canonical Product of Sums (PoS) 4. All Prime Implicants (PI's) 5. Coverage Chart. 6. All essential PI's 7. Minterms not covered by EPI's 8. Minimized Expression. The project specifics are included in this [report](https://github.com/MohamedRagabAbbas/Digital-Design-Project-Final-Version-1/blob/main/Digital%20Design%20Project%201.pdf)
